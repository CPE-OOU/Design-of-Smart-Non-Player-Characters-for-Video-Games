Design of Smart Non-Player Characters for Video Games

Password to Unzip the file(Follow as written with the camel casing and underscore!): Unreal_Engine_5.3

Minimum System Requirement: The HP Victus 15 gaming laptop was procured, and its system specifications include the utilization of a 12th Gen Core i5-12450H processor, a 15.6 Inch FHD display screen, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and a respectable NVidia GeForce GTX 1650 4GB graphics card. (And no, this wasn't dropped for school. The VR headset was dropped!!!)

Software Requirement: Nothing below Unreal Engine version 5.3!

About of the project: This final-year project uses Behaviour Trees (BTs) to develop and build intelligent Non-Player Characters (NPCs) for video games. By providing a hierarchical structure for constructing complicated decision-making processes.

Work done: During the course of this project, we were able to develop the virtual environment where players and NPCs can interact (found in Environment_Testing file when loaded in UE5.3, in folder PolygonPrototype/Maps/Demonstration). Our in-game characters have been rigged appropriately to synchronize with the given animations. We further designed the AI perception system, patrol system for the enemy AI, the Environment Query System (EQS). Additionally, the damage system for both players and NPCs where implemented, as well as player attack and an enemy block feature. A combat state feature alongside stealth-seeking were designed.

Work Left: Integrating the designed game prototype with the Oculus Quest 2 headset.

Enjoy and have fun with the journey that lies ahead!!!!
